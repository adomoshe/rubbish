# RUBBISH

### MISSION STATEMENT:

#### This app is meant to resolve the little inconveniences in our daily lives whilst hopefully enhancing our neighbor to neighbor relationships. Instead of having to call our friends cousin twice removed from the other side of the city to help us take the trash bins out on Wednesday night, this app connects you to a trustworthy volunteer down the street to help you out.

### TARGET: 

 Homeowners who are disabled, need assistance, travel frequently, etc. 

### TEAM:

**Sherrie Lin** Front-end development, UIUX design<br/>
**Jessica Nguyen** Front-end development<br/>
**Ashkan Wadpey** Back-end development<br/>
**Ado Moshe** Back-end development<br/>


### HOW *RUBBISH* WORKS:

User creates new account (if first-time) and chooses to be either a volunteer or someone who needs volunteers. Once logged in, if you are a user in need of volunteers, you can make posts on the wall with a simple headline and description. Volunteers will see that wall and be able to contact you through the click of a button. Once a volunteer decides to contact you, a direct message is initiated between the two users, allowing a service to be discussed and completed. RUBBISH can be used as often as daily or as infrequent as a one-off event.
